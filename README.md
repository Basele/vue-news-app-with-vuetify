## Acquiring Free API Key

Next step is getting a free API key at [News API](https://newsapi.org/) witch will help us make some call requests to the server and retrieve the news articles. 

Once the api key is in your hands, go to `/src/app/news-api.service.ts` and paste it to where it said put “PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE”.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
